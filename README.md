# 🌆 Smart City: Energy & Traffic Optimization (Power BI Project)

**Project by Kalaiselvi M **

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing and optimizing smart city operations through **data-driven insights** on **energy usage**, **traffic patterns**, and an **integrated dashboard** for better urban management.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
The project consists of **three interactive dashboards** designed to support sustainable and efficient city planning:

### 1️⃣ Energy Dashboard
- Analyzes power consumption across different city zones.  
- Highlights areas with high energy usage.  
- Tracks renewable energy contribution and trends over time.  

### 2️⃣ Traffic Dashboard
- Displays real-time vehicle flow and congestion levels.  
- Shows average speed and high-traffic routes.  
- Provides insights for improving traffic management and reducing delays.  

### 3️⃣ Integrated Dashboard
- Combines energy and traffic data to analyze interconnections.  
- Helps identify correlations between energy usage and traffic patterns.  
- Supports holistic city optimization strategies.
